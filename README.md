# Chess Game

**<p>In this project, I created a chess game with React. Help was taken from chess js regarding the movements of the pieces in the chess game, in short, the gameplay process. React dnd was also used for drag and drop operations. Rx js was used to update the status information of the chess board. Changing pieces when the pawn goes to the last row. If you want to experience the game, you can access the live version of the project below.</p>**
